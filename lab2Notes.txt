Lab #2 - CSRF where token validation depends on request method 

Vulnerable parameter - email change functionality 

Goal - exploit CSRF to change email address 

CREDS - wiener:peter

Analysis:

In order for a CSRF attack to be possible:
- A relevant action : Change a users email
- Cooki-based session handling: session cookie 
- No  unpredictable request parameters 

1. Intercept the request and send info to repeater
2. Request returns a CSRF token, deleting wont work 
3. Change the request method from POST > GET and delete the CSRF Token SEND and it will pass
