Lab #7 Referer validation depends on header being present






Analysis:
In order for a CSRF attack to be possible:
- A relevant action : Change a users email
- Cooki-based session handling: session cookie 
- No  unpredictable request parameters: referer header is generated, remove it and sumbit

1. Intercept request
2. "referrer" is present 
3. Delete entire reference to referrer clear white space and submit 
4. Must add code above form tag
<meta name="referrer" content="no-referrer">
