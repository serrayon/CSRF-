MAKE SURE YOU use new credentials, the target link and then the csrf token must be new. 
credentials : wiener:peter,  carlos:montoya

Analysis:
In order for a CSRF attack to be possible:
- A relevant action : Change a users email
- Cooki-based session handling: session cookie 
- No  unpredictable request parameters: CSRF token is not tied to user 


Testing CSRF tokens:
1. Remove the CSRF Tokend and see if application accepts request 
2. Change the request method from POST to GET 
3. See if csrf token is tied to user session
