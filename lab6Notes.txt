Lab #6 CSRF token is duplicated, It attempts to use the insecure "double submit" CSRF prevention technique.






Analysis:
In order for a CSRF attack to be possible:
- A relevant action : Change a users email
- Cooki-based session handling: session cookie 
- No  unpredictable request parameters: Change both CSRF key and token to the same random value


1. Intercept request 
2. 2 CSRF tokens will be provided 
3. Change both to 'TEST' and submit
