<!--
Turn intercept on once you are on the change email page
Send to repeater and turn off intercept
Work from repeater 
Change the get method to POST that is how the exploit occurs
POST method wont check for CRSF authentication and could be 
vulnerable 
The target address is pulled from repeater 
The remaining address "my-account....'''is also on repeater 
The fishing link is created from 
https://127.0.0.1:8000/name of script 
https://127.0.0.1:8000/csrf-lab-02.html
python3 -m http.server 

I cant get the Chrome page to load the server due to SSL errors 
firgure this out
