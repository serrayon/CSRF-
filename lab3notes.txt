Analysis 

In order for a CSRF attack to be possible:
- A relevant action : Change a users email
- Cooki-based session handling: session cookie 
- No  unpredictable request parameters: CSRF token is not mandatory

Testing CSRF Tokends:
1. Remove the CSRF token and see if application accepts request 
2. Change the request method from POST to GET 



Solution: 
1. Send the change of email and intercept it. 
2. Send to repeater and turn offintercept. 
3. From repeater remove CSRF Token and press send. Status shoudl be 
302 found, then click Follow redirect and search for the new email
